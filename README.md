## My new patch to bypass coc tutorial ! (not public for the moment)
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/1.PNG)
### What you can do with a th1 :
- You only can upgrade th1 --> th2 and build "Builder's Hut"
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/2.PNG)
- Even if you are th1, a # (ID) is assigned to your account so others can add you BUT you can't accept them, you don't see their request but you can add them
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/3.PNG)
- The only thing you can buy except "Builder's Hut" is Torch
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/4.PNG)
- You can play Goblin's War and win ressources etc
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/5.PNG)
- Things not listed in the "what you can't do" part are theoretically achievable (I forgot that you can connect to supercell ID with a th1)
### What you can't do with a th1 (troop waiting list is maybe specific to this patch):
- You can't make a troop waiting list, server detect something is wrong
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/6.PNG)
- You can't attack, but I will try later to bypass security to play, anyway for the moment
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slayy2357/coc-exploit/main/pictures/7.PNG)
- And finaly you can't upgrade anything (except th1 / Builder's Hut)

### What's next ?
I'm already working on the second part of the patch to :
- Enable attacks, so bypass things that check th level before attack
- A way to get more ressources (to repare the clan castle), two way to do this : bypass th2 requirement to upgrade elixir pump etc, or enable offers that are disabled on th1 to buy elixir etc (more chances to work)
### Requirements to install the patch (when public) :
For the moment :
- A computer
- A jailbreakable iOS device (not for android for the moment)

# BIG UPDATE (now the patch bypass security and can attack on th1 !)
